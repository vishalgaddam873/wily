## Prerequisites

- [Node.js > 12](https://nodejs.org) and npm (Recommended: Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman)
- [Xcode 12](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)
- [Cocoapods 1.10.1](https://cocoapods.org)
- [JDK > 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Android Studio and Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio)


## Usage

#### Follow below steps to run the app 

- Go to your project's root folder and run `npm install`.
- Run `npm start` or `expo start` to run the project!

### `npm start`

Runs the project in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
# or 
expo start -c

```

## Folder structure

This template follows a very simple project structure:

- `assets`: Asset folder to store all images, vectors, etc.
- `components`: Folder to store any common component that you use through your app (such as a generic button)
- `screens`: Folder that contains all your application screens/features.
- `App.js`: Main component that starts your whole app.
